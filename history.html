              <h3>Story of Sanaa Ghanoum</h3>
              <p>
                The founder of Hans Andersen Nursery, Sanaa Ghanoum, is originally from Libanon.
                She traveled to Denmark in the '80s and worked as a teacher while gaining her Bachelor's degree in pedagogy
                After gaining her academic achievement, she worked in several childcare institutes.
                Meanwhile, she also started a story-telling company, where she would travel around in Denmark to tell stories from the famous danish author H. C. Andersen.
                <br>
                <br>
                While work in Denmark gave her a theoretical and practical foundation, she always dreamt of opening a children's nursery in Egypt. The country where her mother was born.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2010 she opened her first children's nursery in Alexandria, quickly followed by a second.
                Since then, she has educated hundreds of children and teachers in a European educational style.
                Her dream has been realized, but she still strives on a daily basis to make a change for every child who sets his or her feet in Hans Andersen Nursery.

              <h3>Story of H. C. Andersen</h3>
              <p>
                Hans C. Andersen achieved worldwide fame for writing innovative and influential fairy tales.
                Many of his stories, including "The Ugly Duckling" and "The Princess and the Pea," remain classics of the genre.
                <br>
                <br>
                Andersen's work first gained recognition in 1829, with the publication of a short story entitled
                "A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager."
                He followed this with the publication of a play, a book of poetry and a travelogue.
                The promising young author won a grant from the king, allowing him to travel across Europe
                and further develop his body of work. A novel based on his time in Italy, The Improvisatore,
                was published in 1835. The same year, Andersen began producing fairy tales.
